<p> Description: </p>
	<li> Thick chewy <b>noodles</b> made out of wheat about 2-4 millimeters. It's similar to Ramen but the noodles are thicker.
	<li> It is served in many different rich warm <b>broths</b>.
	<li> There are many different <b> types </b> of udon, including: Kake Udon (my favorite), Zaru Udon, Yaki Udon, Curry Udon, Mizusawa Udon.
	<li> It is commonly used in Japanese cuisine, but sources say that it may have originated in China
</li>
<p> Where to go: </p>
<p> My personal favorite place to buy udon is <a href="https://www.marugameudon.com/" target="_blank">Marugame</a>
which has three locations: in the SF Stonestown mall, Alameda, and Berkeley. I always order the BK udon with an egg and all of the toppings. For the people who enjoy meat, I recomend the Nikutama. They also have lots of different tempura to choose from. I get the tamago (fried egg). </p>
