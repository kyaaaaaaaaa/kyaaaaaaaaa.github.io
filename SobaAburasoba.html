	<p>Description:</p>
		<li>Abura soba, also known as mazesoba, is a popular Japanese dish consisting of noodles mixed with a sauce of oil, soy sauce, and other seasonings, without the traditional broth found in ramen</li>
		<li>Aburasoba's origins are in Kitatama, Japan in the 1950's</li>
		<li>Soba is a thin, Japanese noodle made primarily from buckwheat flour, often served hot in broth or cold with a dipping sauce</li>
