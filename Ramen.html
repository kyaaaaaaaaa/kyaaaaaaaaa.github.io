	<p>Here are some of my <b>favorites</b>, and some <b>tips</b> on where to go.</p>
	<p>Description:</p>
		<li>A Japanese noodle soup, with a combination of a rich flavoured broth, one of a variety of types of noodle and a selection of meats or vegetables, often topped with a boiled egg. It's similar to Udon but the noodles are thinner.</li>
		<li>Ramen's origins are in China, specifically with lamian, a type of Chinese noodle, and it was introduced to Japan in the late 19th century. </li>
		<li>The first ramen shop was Rairaiken, which opened in Asakusa, Tokyo, in 1910.</li>

	<p>Where to go:</p>
		<li> My personal favorite place currently is <a href="https://www.taishokenusa.com/" target="_blank">Taishoken</a> which is in San Francisco and San Mateo. </li>
